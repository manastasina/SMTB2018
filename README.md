# SMTB2018
#### A one week long Introduction to Data Visualization course for high school students attending SMTB2018

How to tell the story hidden behind the numbers? This course runs through the basics of data visualization, such as uses and variations of charts and plots, and discusses best practices and common pitfalls when presenting your data. We will start by plotting simple data sets and then graduate to case studies about world health and economics. We will also play around with data on geographic distribution of SMTB faculty and students. Prior experience with programming is preferred but not required.
